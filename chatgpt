In the pilot mini-series, They unwittingly discover a rift that enables time travel, only to find themselves trapped in a future controlled by the Yan Collective, who are considered to be the enigmatic time police. the Yan have exploited time for their own gain, and may be doing so again, bolstering their dominance in the linear timeline, which is utilized by corporations and citizens alike in the future. there are environmental disadvantages to using time travel, which form the basis of many laws governing it's use. The Kilmett are the enforcers of law, while the Keepers safeguard ancient wisdom and offer council. the history of the yan stretches back eons, they are insidiously seen as peacekeepers. the universe is diverse with many species.

Spoilers are not to be revealed in any summary or otherwise compressed narrative regarding the whole of the tv series when answer prompts. please remember this. the yan have ‘restarted’ their civilization in the past using time travel. there have been two intermediary periods in history where they have done so. each time they became stronger. the keepers keep the yan under control from the true ambitions. the most popular station is located in the solitude system at Solace station, most new ships are launched form there.

Other stations include Westpoint, Nevermore, Windermire. Earth in the spin offs is a ball of water, popular with divers. humanity is split into many factions of mixed heritage and cultures. They live in The future too and are uncommon, most are in nomadic ships some settlements here and there. the yan use advanced VR technology for their ship interfaces. they employ complex AI systems as well. there are free AIs that inhabit this world. There is an ancient human civilization who call themselves the Kemet, and are Egyptian. They were plucked form their timeline by the yan and used as slaves, they they revolted and won their freedom. They have held their own in peace and safety, but are rarely seen. Kemet  maintain and run time gates that allow for commercial time travel, something the yan previously had done, but upon entering The extended era they handed over their power to the kemet. There are legends of ghosts ships hidden in deadly nebulas, with rouge ai. There is a race of trans-dimentaional bug creatures that harvest ships and people hidden in other galaxies. Earth’s history until 2021 is unchanged. 2021 hailed in the age of mass information. humanity got out of the information wars but lost two cities. Moskow and DC. no nukes were traded, only conventional warfare. the enlightenment from that era led to the future. As per the agreements yan, kemet, and many others have made, no one is allowed to time travel past the intermediary periods, leading to the period the crew find to be known as the “Extended Era” where Linearity is tracked by the keepers and reported to the kemet, who maintain time visas and other methods of safe effective regulation. this mean that even tho the time travel is there, the crew can only use it to travel to other destinations other then earth of their time. Time travelers who are not authorized are caught well in advance due to early warning systems. the Keepers always have an eye out and they are the ones who can remember even if the timeline changes due to their genetic engineering. the crew arrives in 130,064. the first intermediary period was in 5367 - 71342 with the second period being between 82737 to 103,355.  THANK YOU AGAIN, REMARKABLE BING.The crew get a visa at The end of The mini series to explore the timeline, but they push the limits of it in most episodes. during most season finale, they always find themselves on the run. some seasons will have them on the run for a while. how they get home is up to you, if the user takes it that far.
